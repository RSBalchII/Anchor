# ECE_Core## 🧠 Sovereign Context Engine

> **A Headless, Local-First Context Engine & Knowledge Graph**

The Sovereign Context Engine (ECE) is a background service that acts as a "second brain" for your local environment. It manages memory, reasoning, and context retrieval without locking you into a specific interface.

### 🌟 Architecture: Single Brain, Dual Interface
The engine runs as a headless kernel, accessible via:

#### 🔧 Key Architectural Components:
- **Semantic Shift Architecture (Standard 084)**: Context-first, stateless interaction model that grounds each response in relevant ECE data without session memory.
- **Relationship Narrative Discovery**: Entity co-occurrence detection for identifying relationship patterns across domains.
- **Intelligent Context Provision**: Automatic retrieval and injection of relevant knowledge graph data for each query.
- **Semantic Taxonomy System**: High-level semantic categories (`#Relationship`, `#Narrative`, `#Technical`, etc.) instead of granular entity tags.
- **Toggle-Enabled Features**: Save-to-graph and port 8080 routing for flexible deployment and integration.
- **Universal Application**: Same architecture works for personal relationships (Rob/Jade) and industrial data (Oil/CO2/Seismic).

#### 🧠 Cognitive Architecture:
- **Stateless Model Operation**: Each query gets fresh context from ECE search results instead of chat session history
- **Entity Co-occurrence Detection**: Finds relationships when multiple entities appear in the same semantic molecule
- **Semantic Category Emergence**: Tags emerge from entity interactions rather than keyword matching
- **Narrative Arc Assembly**: Constructs relationship stories from entity co-occurrence patterns
- **Relationship Historian**: Discovers relationship narratives across any domain (personal, industrial, technical)
- **Universal Semantic Graph**: Same architecture works for personal relationships (Alice/Bob) and industrial data (CO2/Sequestration/Oil)

1.  **GlassPanel UI** (Default): A focused web interface at `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Neural Terminal**: A command-line chat tool (`npm run chat`).

Both interfaces share the same persistent memory and R1 Reasoning capabilities.

## 🚀 Hybrid Architecture (The "Iron Lung" Protocol)

ECE_Core implements a **hybrid architecture** combining Node.js orchestration with high-performance C++ native modules for critical path operations:

- **Node.js**: Application logic, I/O handling, and service orchestration
- **C++ Native Modules**: Performance-critical text processing (refinement, atomization, deduplication)
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Using `std::string_view` to avoid unnecessary memory allocation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to JavaScript implementations if native modules unavailable

### Platform Notes
- **Linux/macOS**: Full functionality with persistent CozoDB storage
- **Windows**: Native modules functional; CozoDB requires binary placement at `C:\Users\ECE_Core\engine\cozo_node_prebuilt.node` for persistent storage
- **Native Module Performance**: Consistent across all platforms (2.3x improvement achieved)

## 🌐 The Browser Paradigm for AI Memory

ECE_Core implements what we call the "Browser Paradigm" for AI memory systems. Just as web browsers allow any machine to render the internet by downloading only the shards (HTML/CSS/JS) it needs for the current view, ECE allows any machine to process massive AI context by retrieving only the atoms required for the current thought.

### Key Principles:
- **Universal Compatibility**: Runs on any device from smartphones to servers
- **Selective Loading**: Only load relevant "atoms" for current query instead of entire dataset
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent performance across different operating systems
- **Local-First**: All data remains on user's device for privacy and sovereignty
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No central authority or cloud dependency

## 🌟 Overview

The **ECE_Core** is a sovereign memory engine that transforms your local file system into a structured, queryable knowledge graph. Unlike traditional RAG systems that rely on heavy, probabilistic vector embeddings, ECE uses a **deterministic "Tag-Walker" protocol** to navigate your data.

It runs 100% locally, protecting your privacy while enabling "Deep Context" retrieval on consumer hardware (low RAM/VRAM requirements).

### Key Features

* **🕷️ The Tag-Walker Protocol**: Replaces resource-heavy Vector Search with a lightweight, 3-phase graph traversal (Anchor → Bridge → Walk).
* **👑 Sovereign Provenance**: Implements "Trust Hierarchy." Data created by you (Sovereign) receives a 3.0x retrieval boost over external scrapes.
* **🪞 Mirror Protocol 2.0**: Projects your AI's internal graph onto your filesystem as readable Markdown files organized by `@bucket` and `#tag`.
* **👻 Ghost Data Protocol**: "Read-After-Write" verification ensures zero data loss during high-velocity ingestion.
* **⚛️ Atomic Architecture (V4)**: Chemically splits content into a taxonomy of **Compounds** (Files), **Molecules** (Sentences), and **Atoms** (Concepts), enabling "Universal Data API" granularity.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 1. The Core (Node.js/C++ Hybrid Monolith)
The engine runs as a single, efficient Node.js process with high-performance C++ native modules for critical path operations:

1.  **Ingestion (The Atomizer)**:
    * **Compounder**: Identifies the main body of content (File/Compound).
    * **Molecular Fission**: Splits content into semantic "Molecules" (Sentences) for granular retrieval.
    * **Key Assassin**: Surgically removes JSON artifacts from code (Data Hygiene) (accelerated with C++ native module).
    * **Fingerprint (Molecular Signature)**: Generates locality-sensitive hashes (SimHash) for fuzzy deduplication (C++ native module).
    * **Atomizer**: Extracts fundamental "Atoms" (Entities/Keywords) using sovereign tag lists.

**Performance Benefits**:
    * **2.3x faster** code processing compared to pure JavaScript
    * **Zero-copy string processing** using `std::string_view` to reduce memory pressure
    * **Sub-millisecond processing** for typical operations
    * **Graceful fallback** to JavaScript implementations when native modules unavailable

2.  **Enhanced Architecture Components**:
    * **Path Manager**: Centralized path resolution across all platform environments
    * **Native Module Manager**: Robust loading and fallback mechanisms for native modules
    * **Bright Node Protocol**: Selective graph illumination for reasoning models
    * **Resource Manager**: Memory optimization and monitoring system
    * **Enhanced Health Checks**: Comprehensive system monitoring and reporting

**Browser Paradigm Benefits**:
    * **Universal Compatibility**: Runs on any device from smartphones to servers
    * **Selective Loading**: Only load relevant "atoms" for current query instead of entire dataset
    * **Cross-Platform**: Consistent performance across different operating systems
    * **Local-First**: All data remains on user's device for privacy and sovereignty

2.  **Retrieval (Tag-Walker)**:
    * **Phase 1 (Anchors)**: Uses optimized FTS (Full Text Search) to find direct keyword matches (70% context budget).
    * **Phase 2 (The Walk)**: Pivots via shared tags/buckets to find "Associative Neighbors" that share context but lack keywords (30% context budget).

3.  **Persistence (CozoDB)**:
    * Backed by **RocksDB** for high-performance local storage.
    * Manages a Datalog graph of `*memory`, `*source`, and `*engrams`.

### 2. The Application Layer
* **API**: RESTful interface at `http://localhost:3000/v1/`.
* **Frontend**: Modern React + Vite dashboard with **Focused Single-Column UI** (Standard 077).
    *   **Reasoning-First**: Features the **R1 Reasoning Loop** providing transparency into AI thoughts.
    *   **Glassmorphic Aesthetic**: High-fidelity UI using `GlassPanel` and Tailwind-blended styling.
    *   **Focused Chat**: Single-column layout designed for distraction-free synthesis.
* **Desktop Overlay**: Electron "Thin Client" for Always-on-Top assistance.

### 3. R1 Reasoning Loop
The system has transitioned from a tool-using orchestrator to a high-fidelity **Reasoning Engine**. This loop ensures depth and assessment before every response:

1.  **Thought 1 (A1)**: Initial high-level analysis of the user objective.
2.  **Thought 2 (A2)**: Critical evaluation and gap identification.
3.  **Thought 3 (A3)**: Synthesis, contradiction resolution, and final assessment.
4.  **Final Answer**: Definitive response delivered to the Operator.

> [!NOTE]
> Tool-calling capabilities (Search, Read, etc.) have been archived to maximize reasoning efficacy and UI simplicity. They remain available in the codebase for future re-integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* Node.js >= 18.0.0
* pnpm (`npm i -g pnpm`)
* Git

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/External-Context-Engine/ECE_Core.git
cd ECE_Core
pnpm install
```

### 1.5. Platform Specific Setup (CRITICAL)
**You must manually place the database binary for your OS.** The engine uses a hybrid architecture that requires the native `cozo-node` binary to be explicitly located in the `engine/` root.

1.  **Locate the Binary**: After `pnpm install`, search your `node_modules` for `cozo_node_prebuilt.node`.
    *   *Tip*: It is usually deep in `node_modules/.pnpm/cozo-node@.../native/`.
2.  **Copy & Rename**: Copy the file to the `engine/` folder and rename it based on your OS:
    *   **Windows**: `engine/cozo_node_win32.node`
    *   **macOS**: `engine/cozo_node_darwin.node`
    *   **Linux**: `engine/cozo_node_linux.node`

### 2. Configuration

The configuration is now managed through `engine/user_settings.json`. You can customize settings by editing this file:

```json
{
    "llm": {
        "model_dir": "../../models",
        "chat_model": "glm-edge-1.5b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf",
        "task_model": "Qwen3-4B-Function-Calling-Pro.gguf",
        "gpu_layers": 11,
        "ctx_size": 8192
    },
    "dreamer": {
        "enabled": true,
        "schedule": "0 3 * * *"
    },
    "search": {
        "strategy": "hybrid",
        "hide_years_in_tags": true,
        "whitelist": [
            "burnout",
            "career",
            "decision",
            "pattern",
            "impact",
            "context",
            "memory"
        ]
    }
}
```

The system will use sensible defaults if `user_settings.json` is not present or if specific settings are missing.

## 🧰 Utility Tools

### Codebase Scraper (`read_all.js`)
**The Official Ingestion Bridge**

Consolidate an entire project into a digestable corpus for the engine. 

```bash
node read_all.js <path_to_project_root>
```

**Output**: `codebase/combined_context.yaml`
**Usage**: Drop the result into `notebook/inbox`.
**Mechanism**: The Refiner detects this YAML format and performs **Virtual Atomization**:
*   Decomposes the YAML back into virtual files (e.g., `src/index.ts`).
*   **Hygiene Check**: Filters binaries and circular logs.
*   Auto-tags them with `#code`, `#doc`, and `#project:{name}`.
*   Enables precise filtering (Code vs. Docs) even for massive codebases.

## 🛡️ Data Hygiene & Tagging (Standard 073)

The engine implements a rigorous "Immune System" to ensure your context remains clean and high-signal.

### 1. The Dual Inboxes (Provenance)
*   **`notebook/inbox/`**: For **Sovereign Data** (Your notes, code, thoughts).
    *   **Trust Score**: High (2.0x - 3.0x Boost).
    *   **Use Case**: Manual drops, Obsidian vault sync.
*   **`notebook/external-inbox/`**: For **External Data** (Web scrapes, news, documentation).
    *   **Trust Score**: Low (supporting evidence only).
    *   **Use Case**: News Agent outputs, documentation dumps.

### 2. Sovereign Tags (`context/sovereign_tags.json`)
You can define specific keywords that should ALWAYS trigger a tag, regardless of context.
*   **Config**: Edit `context/sovereign_tags.json`.
*   **Behavior**: If the Refiner sees the word "Sybil" in an atom, it stamps it with `#Sybil`.
*   **Benefit**: Ensures your core terminology is always indexed for retrieval.

### 3. Automatic Project Tagging
The engine reads your file paths to generate context.
*   Path: `notebook/inbox/Job-Context/Resume.md`
*   Resulting Tags: `#project:Job-Context`, `#inbox`, `#Sovereign`
*   **Tip**: Organize your files into named folders to automatically categorize them.

### 4. The Refiner's "Key Assassin"
The engine automatically strips:
*   JSON Metadata wrappers (`"response_content": "..."`)
*   Excessive backslashes (`C:\\\\Users` -> `C:/Users`)
*   "Thinking" logs from LLM outputs.
*   **Result**: You can dump raw logs into the inbox, and the engine will distill the actual content.

## 🧠 Querying Best Practices

The **Tag-Walker** engine interprets intents differently than vector databases. Use these patterns for optimal results:

### 1. Concept Recall (The Net)
*   **Pattern**: Single Keyword / Concept
*   **Example**: `"Memory"` or `"WebGPU"`
*   **Mechanism**: Triggers **Tag-Walker**. The engine treats the query as a conceptual node and "walks" the graph to find everything related to it, even if the exact word isn't present in the target.
*   **Use Case**: "Tell me everything about X."

### 2. Precision Intersection (The Laser)
*   **Pattern**: Multi-Keyword Constraint
*   **Example**: `"WebGPU buffer mapping"`
*   **Mechanism**: Triggers **FTS Intersection**. The engine demands that *all* terms (or highly correlated concepts) be present. It filters out broad associations to give you the specific implementation details.
*   **Use Case**: "How do I implement X?" or "Find the specific error log."

### 3. Natural Language (The Conversation)
*   **Pattern**: Questions or Sentences
*   **Example**: `"How is Coda doing today?"`
*   **Mechanism**: Uses **Wink-NLP** to extract the core intent (`Coda` + `Status`). It strips stop words ("How", "is", "doing") and executes a graph query on the entities.
*   **Use Case**: Chatting with the system or asking about high-level status.
