# Context Engine (Sovereign Edition)

> **Philosophy:** Your mind, augmented. Your data, sovereign. Your tools, open.

A **Headless Node.js** cognitive extraction system. No browser dependencies. No cloud. No installation.
Just you, Node.js, and your infinite context.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

1.  **Download** this repository.
2.  **Install** Node.js dependencies: `cd engine && npm install`
3.  **Inject Context**: Drop any `.md`, `.txt`, or `.yaml` files into the `context/` directory.
4.  **Launch** the unified system: `start_engine.bat`
5.  **Search**: Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` to query your memories.

*That's it. You are running a headless context engine with persistent Graph Memory.*

## 📋 Script Running Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: To prevent getting stuck in long-running loops, follow the script running protocol:

- All services run in detached mode with logging to the `logs/` directory
- Never run long-running processes in attached mode
- Check log files in `logs/` directory to monitor system status
- Use `start_engine.bat` or `start_engine.ps1` to start the system properly

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system now runs in `engine/` using Node.js with direct CozoDB integration.

```

### 2. Core Components
*   **Engine**: `src/index.js` - Node.js server with Express, CORS, and body-parser.
*   **Memory**: `CozoDB (Node)` - Stores relations (`*memory`) with RocksDB persistence.
*   **Ingestion**: `chokidar` - Watches `context/` directory for file changes and auto-ingests.
*   **Core**: `engine/` - Node.js monolith handling API, ingestion, and database operations.
*   **Data**: `context/` - Directory for storing context files that are automatically monitored.

## 🏛️ Node.js Monolith Architecture

The system now features the unified Node.js monolith architecture for simplified deployment:

*   **Sovereign Engine**: Single-process Node.js server handling API, ingestion, and database on port 3000
*   **CozoDB Integration**: Direct integration with `cozo-node` using RocksDB backend
*   **File Watcher**: `chokidar` monitors `context/` directory for automatic ingestion
*   **API Endpoints**: Standardized endpoints for ingestion, querying, and health checks

### Getting Started with Node.js Monolith
1. Install dependencies: `cd engine && npm install`
2. Start the unified system: `start_engine.bat` (or `start_engine.ps1`)
3. Access the health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
4. Use the API endpoints for ingestion and querying

### API Endpoints
*   `POST /v1/memory/search` - **Cognitive Search**: Returns "Elastic Window" snippets grouped by file.
*   `POST /v1/ingest` - Content ingestion endpoint (manual override).
*   `POST /v1/query` - Raw CozoDB query execution endpoint.
*   `GET /health` - Service health verification endpoint.

## 🧠 Cognitive Retrieval (Elastic Window)

The engine uses a sophisticated **"Elastic Window"** strategy to solve the "Keyword Saturation" problem (where large files flood the LLM context).

### 1. BM25 Full-Text Search
When you query the engine, it first performs a **BM25 Full-Text Search** across the entire database to find the most relevant documents.

### 2. Elastic Snippeting
Instead of returning the whole file, the engine:
- **Scans** for every occurrence of your keywords.
- **Allocates** a character budget (default 5000) across all hits.
- **Expands** a "window" of context (min 300 chars) around each hit to capture full thoughts.
- **Merges** overlapping or nearby snippets to ensure coherence.

### 3. Grouped Output
Results are returned as a **Context Digest**:
- **Source Header**: Printed once per file with a relevance score.
- **Snippets**: All relevant sections from that file listed below the header.
- **Separators**: Clear `---` markers between different sources.

This ensures the LLM receives **high-density, relevant paragraphs** instead of "sentence soup" or massive, irrelevant file chunks.

## � Portability & Snapshots (The "Ship" Protocol)

The Context Engine is designed for **Zero-Cloud Portability**. You can move your entire cognitive history between machines without a database server.

### 1. Exporting Your Mind
- **UI Export**: Click the **"Export Snapshot"** button in the dashboard.
- **API Export**: `GET /v1/backup` returns a portable YAML file containing every memory, hash, and bucket.
- **Storage**: Snapshots are saved to the `backups/` directory as `cozo_memory_snapshot_YYYY-MM-DD.yaml`.
- **Git Policy**: The `backups/` folder is ignored by Git to keep your repository clean, but these files are your primary "Cognitive Backups."

### 2. Moving to a New Machine
To move your context to a new device:
1.  **Copy** your latest `.yaml` snapshot to the new machine.
2.  **Install** Node.js and run `npm install` in the `engine/` folder.
3.  **Hydrate**: Run the hydration command:
    ```bash
    cd engine
    node src/hydrate.js ../backups/your_snapshot.yaml
    ```
4.  **Launch**: Run `start_engine.bat`. Your entire history is now live on the new machine.

### 3. Why Snapshots?
- **Human Readable**: You can open the `.yaml` file in any text editor to see your data.
- **Deduplication**: The engine uses MD5 hashing to ensure that if you re-ingest the same file, it doesn't create duplicates.
- **Bucket Preservation**: Your custom partitions (e.g., "research", "coding") are preserved across migrations.

## �🔄 Context Collection & Migration

The system now includes comprehensive context collection and legacy migration:

*   **Legacy Migration**: `engine/src/migrate_history.js` consolidates legacy session files into YAML/JSON
*   **Context Collection**: `read_all.js` and `engine/src/read_all.js` aggregate content from project directories
*   **File Monitoring**: Automatic ingestion of new files in `context/` directory
*   **Multi-Format Output**: Generates text, JSON, and YAML formats for maximum compatibility
*   **Archive Strategy**: Legacy V2 artifacts archived to `archive/v2_python_bridge/`

### Data Migration Process
1. Legacy session files consolidated from `context/Coding-Notes/Notebook/history/important-context/sessions/`
2. Converted to YAML format in `context/full_history.yaml` and `context/full_history.json`
3. Auto-ingested into CozoDB for persistent storage
4. Legacy Python infrastructure archived for historical reference

### Context Collection Strategy
*   **File Discovery**: Recursive scanning of `context/` directory
*   **Format Support**: Handles .json, .md, .yaml, .txt, .py, .js, .html, .css, .sh, .ps1, .bat
*   **Exclusion Rules**: Skips common build directories, logs, and combined outputs
*   **Encoding Detection**: Robust encoding handling for various file types
*   **Structured Output**: Generates both JSON and YAML memory files
