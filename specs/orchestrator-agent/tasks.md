# Orchestrator Agent - tasks.md

This document breaks down the work required to implement the `Orchestrator` agent.

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

-   [x] **Task 1.1: Project Scaffolding**
    -   Create the directory and main agent file: `ece/agents/tier1/orchestrator/orchestrator_agent.py`.
-   [x] **Task 1.2: Redis Cache Integration**
    -   Implement the connection to Redis.
    -   Implement the primary `store` and `retrieve` methods for managing the context cache.

### Phase 2: Task Delegation

-   [x] **Task 2.1: Thinker Registry**
    -   Implement a dynamic registry to keep track of available `Thinker` agents and their specializations.
-   [x] **Task 2.2: Delegation Logic**
    -   Implement the core logic to analyze an incoming prompt and determine which, if any, `Thinker` is required.
-   [x] **Task 2.3: Thinker Communication**
    -   Implement the internal client to call the selected `Thinker` agent and receive its structured response.

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Control Flow

-   [x] **Task 3.1: Response Synthesis**
    -   Implement the logic to synthesize a final response from the prompt, cache context, and `Thinker` output.
-   [x] **Task 3.2: Thought Loop**
    -   Implement the control flow for internal thought loops, allowing the `Orchestrator` to chain calls to `Thinkers` to solve multi-step problems.
-   [x] **Task 3.3: Testing**
    -   Write unit tests for the delegation logic.
    -   Write an integration test with a mock `Thinker` to verify the end-to-end processing loop.
