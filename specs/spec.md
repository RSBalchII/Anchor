# ECE_Core - Technical Specification

## Mission

Build a **personal external memory system** as an assistive cognitive tool using:
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Node.js/C++ with native modules for performance-critical operations.
- **CozoDB (RocksDB)**: Unified graph-relational-vector-fts engine (Replacing Neo4j/Redis).
- **Tag-Walker Protocol**: Graph-based associative retrieval (Replacing legacy Vector Search).
- **Mirror 2.0**: Tangible Knowledge Graph filesystem projections.
- **Local-first LLM integration**: `node-llama-cpp` for GGUF support.
- **Browser Paradigm**: Universal compatibility through selective loading and cross-platform design.
- **Semantic Shift Architecture (Standard 084)**: Context-first, stateless interaction model that grounds each response in relevant ECE data without session memory.
- **Relationship Narrative Discovery**: Entity co-occurrence detection for identifying relationship patterns across domains.

## The Semantic Shift Architecture (Standard 084)

### Core Philosophy: "Context-First, Stateless Interaction"

The ECE implements a **Stateless Contextual Chat Protocol** that eliminates traditional chat session memory while maximizing contextual relevance through dynamic ECE data retrieval. This approach ensures each interaction is grounded in the most relevant knowledge graph data without accumulating conversational baggage.

### Architecture Evolution: From Keyword Index to Semantic Graph

**Before (Legacy):** Chunk → Atom → Tag (Granular keyword tagging)
**After (Semantic Shift):** Compound → Molecule → Atom (Semantic category tagging)

Where:
- **Compound**: The source file (e.g., journal_entry.yaml)
- **Molecule**: The text chunk with semantic meaning (e.g., paragraph/sentence)
- **Atom**: The atomic entity within molecules (e.g., "Rob", "Jade", "Albuquerque")

### Semantic Category System

The system now uses constrained high-level semantic categories instead of unlimited granular tags:

- `#Relationship`: People interacting, personal connections
- `#Narrative`: Stories, timelines, memories, sequences
- `#Technical`: Code, architecture, system documentation
- `#Industry`: External market data (Oil, CO2, etc.)
- `#Location`: Geographic or spatial references
- `#Emotional`: High sentiment variance content
- `#Temporal`: Time-based sequences and chronology
- `#Causal`: Cause-effect relationships

### Entity Co-occurrence Detection

The system implements "Tag Emergence" where semantic tags emerge from the interaction of entities within semantic molecules:

- **Relationship Detection**: When 2+ person entities appear in the same molecule → `#Relationship` tag
- **Narrative Detection**: When person + time reference appear → `#Narrative` tag
- **Technical Detection**: When technical terms appear → `#Technical` tag
- **Location Detection**: When location references appear → `#Location` tag

### Relationship Narrative Discovery

The system can identify relationship patterns by detecting when entities appear together:

```
Input: "Rob and Jade went to the park yesterday"
Process:
  - Detect entities: ["Rob", "Jade"]
  - Detect relationship indicator: "and"
  - Detect time reference: "yesterday"
  - Apply tags: #Relationship, #Narrative
Output: Molecule tagged with relationship and narrative semantics
```

### Universal Application

The same architecture works across domains:
- **Personal Domain**: Alice/Bob relationship narratives
- **Industrial Domain**: CO2/Sequestration/Oil industry relationships
- **Technical Domain**: Code component relationships
- **Research Domain**: Academic concept relationships

### The Relationship Historian Pattern

The Semantic Shift Architecture implements the "Relationship Historian" pattern that can extract relationship narratives from any domain:

```
Input Domain: Personal Relationships
Input: "Alice and Bob went to the park yesterday"
Process: Detect entities ["Alice", "Bob"], relationship indicator "and", temporal reference "yesterday"
Output: #Relationship, #Narrative tagged molecule

Input Domain: Industrial Data
Input: "CO2 sequestration increased with pressure"
Process: Detect entities ["CO2", "sequestration"], relationship indicator "with", quantitative reference "increased"
Output: #Industry, #Causal tagged molecule

Input Domain: Technical Architecture
Input: "CozoDB and ECE work together for semantic search"
Process: Detect entities ["CozoDB", "ECE"], relationship indicator "work together", functional reference "semantic search"
Output: #Technical, #Relationship tagged molecule
```

This pattern enables the same semantic processing engine to function as a historian for any type of relationship data, making the ECE a truly universal context engine.

### Semantic Categories (High-Level Taxonomy)

Instead of granular entity tags, the system now uses constrained semantic categories:
- `#Relationship`: People interacting, personal connections
- `#Narrative`: Stories, timelines, memories, sequences
- `#Technical`: Code, architecture, system documentation
- `#Industry`: External market data (Oil, CO2, etc.)
- `#Location`: Geographic or spatial references
- `#Emotional`: High sentiment variance content
- `#Temporal`: Time-based sequences and chronology
- `#Causal`: Cause-effect relationships

### Relationship Discovery Protocol

The system implements "Tag Emergence" where semantic tags emerge from the interaction of entities within semantic molecules:
- When 2+ person entities appear in the same molecule → `#Relationship` tag
- When person + time reference appear → `#Narrative` tag
- When technical terms appear → `#Technical` tag
- When location references appear → `#Location` tag
- **Stateless Contextual Chat Protocol (Standard 084)**: Context-first, stateless interaction model that grounds each response in relevant ECE data without session memory.

## Core Architecture

### 1. The Core (Node.js/C++ Hybrid Monolith)
The engine runs as a single, efficient Node.js process with high-performance C++ native modules for critical path operations:

1.  **Ingestion (The Refiner)**:
    * **Atomizer**: Splits text/code into logical units (accelerated with C++ native module).
    * **Key Assassin**: Surgically removes JSON artifacts from code (Data Hygiene) (accelerated with C++ native module).
    * **Fingerprint (SimHash)**: Generates locality-sensitive hashes for fuzzy deduplication (C++ native module).
    * **Enricher**: Assigns `source_id`, `sequence`, and `provenance`.
    * **Zero-Vector**: Stubs embedding slots to maintain schema compatibility without VRAM cost.

**Performance Benefits**:
    * **2.3x faster** code processing compared to pure JavaScript
    * **Zero-copy string processing** using `std::string_view` to reduce memory pressure
    * **Sub-millisecond processing** for typical operations
    * **Graceful fallback** to JavaScript implementations when native modules unavailable

2.  **Retrieval (Tag-Walker)**:
    * **Phase 1 (Anchors)**: Uses optimized FTS (Full Text Search) to find direct keyword matches (70% context budget).
    * **Phase 2 (The Walk)**: Pivots via shared tags/buckets to find "Associative Neighbors" that share context but lack keywords (30% context budget).

3.  **Persistence (CozoDB)**:
    * Backed by **RocksDB** for high-performance local storage.
    * Manages a Datalog graph of `*memory`, `*source`, and `*engrams`.

### 2. The Browser Paradigm Implementation
The system implements the "Browser Paradigm" for AI memory systems:

* **Universal Compatibility**: Runs on any device from smartphones to servers
* **Selective Loading**: Only loads relevant "atoms" for current query instead of entire dataset
* **Cross-Platform**: Consistent performance across different operating systems
* **Local-First**: All data remains on user's device for privacy and sovereignty
