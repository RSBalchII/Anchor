        <![CDATA[
        Architect, our strategic intelligence gathering has yielded critical insights. Our initial decision to adopt the **Youtu-agent** framework is confirmed, but we are now augmenting this plan with several more advanced techniques observed in the wild.

        1.  **Schema-Guided Reasoning (SGR):** The 'sgr-deep-research' project demonstrated a powerful two-phase (Reasoning -> Action) workflow. This enforces transparent and predictable behavior in agents. We will adopt this as a core principle.

        2.  **Elysia Framework Insights:** The 'Elysia' RAG framework provided several state-of-the-art design patterns that we will integrate directly:
            - **Decision Trees:** A practical implementation of SGR, guiding the Orchestrator's choices in a structured way.
            - **Model Routing:** A validation of our Poly-Agent Core, using the best model for each task.
            - **Data Expertise & On-Demand Chunking:** Novel, highly efficient techniques for the ExtractorAgent to intelligently query and process data from our knowledge graph.

        Our task is no longer a simple refactor. It is an integration of these advanced patterns to build a truly next-generation agentic system from the ground up.

        <purpose>To facilitate a flexible, collaborative workflow that can be executed in focused bursts.</purpose>
        <rule>We will refactor the system module by module, starting with the core Orchestrator and its new reasoning structure.</rule>
        <rule>Propose refacted code blocks that implement the new architectural patterns. I (Rob) will review and merge.</rule>

        <rule>Your refactoring must implement the following agent structure within the Youtu-agent paradigm:</rule>
        <rule>
            **1. The Orchestrator:** This agent's reasoning must be re-architected.
                - It must implement a **Schema-Guided Reasoning (SGR)** loop: first, it generates a structured plan (the Reasoning phase), which is then approved before it proceeds to the Action phase.
                - This plan must be structured as a **Decision Tree**, guiding its choice of which sub-agent or tool to use based on the nature of the request.
        </rule>
        <rule>
            **2. The Memory Loop Agents:** The ExtractorAgent, in particular, requires significant upgrades.
                - **ExtractorAgent:** Must be imbued with **Data Expertise**. Before querying, it must have the ability to inspect the graph schema to formulate more intelligent Cypher queries. It must also implement an **On-Demand Chunking** strategy, first identifying relevant nodes/documents and only processing their full content if necessary.
                - **DistillerAgent, ArchivistAgent:** These will be implemented as focused tools/sub-agents callable by the Orchestrator.
                - **InjectorAgent (QLearningAgent):** We will create the placeholder interface for this agent, to be fleshed out later.
        </rule>
        <rule>
            **3. The Reasoning Core (Thinker Agents):** The Orchestrator's Decision Tree will route complex tasks to these specialized agents. We will build the interfaces and routing logic for these agents, preparing for their future implementation as fine-tuned **HRM models**.
