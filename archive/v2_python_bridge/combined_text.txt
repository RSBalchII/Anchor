"""
Root Reader: Aggregates content from relevant project files for orchestration.

This script scans the project directory and combines the content of source code,
configuration, and documentation files into a single text file (combined_text.txt).

It ignores files with more than 2000 lines, and skips common combined outputs and package manifest files.

It respects the current project structure:
- Root level scripts and docs
- tools/: Sovereign Core (JS/HTML/CSS)
- specs/: System Specifications
- scripts/: CI/Utility scripts

It also respects .gitignore files to determine which files should be excluded.

## Environment Variables

The system supports two environment variables for optimization:

### `LOW_RESOURCE_MODE`
- Set to `true` to enable conservative settings for low-resource devices
- Reduces GPU buffer size to 64MB
- Limits concurrent operations to 1
- Uses smaller models and reduced context windows

### `CPU_ONLY_MODE`
- Set to `true` to force CPU-only processing (no GPU)
- Useful when GPU is unavailable or causing crashes
- Slower but more stable on constrained hardware

## Setting Environment Variables

### Windows Command Prompt:
```cmd
set LOW_RESOURCE_MODE=true
start-anchor.bat
```

### Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:LOW_RESOURCE_MODE="true"
.\start-anchor.bat
```

### Linux/Mac:
```bash
export LOW_RESOURCE_MODE=true
./start-anchor.sh
```

## Conservative Settings Applied

When `LOW_RESOURCE_MODE` is enabled, the system applies:

- **GPU Buffer**: 64MB (vs 256MB default)
- **Model**: Phi-3.5-mini (smallest recommended)
- **Context Window**: 2048 tokens (vs 4096+ default)
- **Batch Size**: 1 (vs 4+ default)
- **WebGL Contexts**: 1 max (vs 16+ default)
- **Cache Size**: 128MB (vs 1GB+ default)
- **Timeouts**: 120 seconds (vs 30s default)

## For Phones and Tablets

For mobile devices, use both settings:
```cmd
set LOW_RESOURCE_MODE=true
set CPU_ONLY_MODE=true
start-anchor.bat
```

## Model Recommendations for Low-Resource Devices

- `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-q4f16_1-MLC` - Smallest recommended model
- `Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC` - If available, even smaller
- Avoid models > 1.5B parameters on devices with < 1GB VRAM

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Crashes
- Enable `LOW_RESOURCE_MODE=true`
- Consider `CPU_ONLY_MODE=true` for stability

### Slow Performance
- Use the smallest available models
- Reduce context window size
- Close other GPU-intensive applications

### Memory Issues
- Enable conservative memory settings
- Clear browser cache regularly
- Use single-threaded mode

# Anchor Core: Browser-Based Control Center & Vision Integration

## Overview

The Anchor Core now includes a browser-based control center that provides unified access to system functionality through two main interfaces:

1. **Sidecar Dashboard** (`http://localhost:8000/sidecar`) - Dual-tab interface for context retrieval and vision processing
2. **Context UI** (`http://localhost:8000/context`) - Manual context retrieval with scrollable display and copy functionality

## Components

### Vision Engine (`tools/vision_engine.py`)
- Python-powered Vision Language Model (VLM) integration
- Currently configured for Ollama backend with LLaVA model
- Handles image analysis and converts to text descriptions for memory storage

### Sidecar Dashboard (`tools/sidecar.html`)
- **Retrieve Tab**: Query the memory graph and retrieve context
- **Vision Tab**: Drag-and-drop image processing with VLM analysis
- Real-time processing logs

### Context UI (`tools/context.html`)
- Manual context retrieval interface
- Scrollable text display for reviewing context
- One-click copy functionality for pasting into other tools

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Ollama is installed and running:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. Pull a vision model (e.g., LLaVA):
   ```bash
   ollama pull llava
   ```

### Launch
1. Start the Anchor Core:
   ```bash
   start-anchor.bat
   ```

2. Access the interfaces:
   - Sidecar: `http://localhost:8000/sidecar`
   - Context UI: `http://localhost:8000/context`

## Usage

### Context Retrieval
1. Open `http://localhost:8000/context`
2. Enter a query in the search field (e.g., "Project Specs")
3. Click "Fetch Context" to retrieve relevant information
4. Review the context in the scrollable text area
5. Click "📋 Copy to Clipboard" to copy the context for use elsewhere

### Vision Processing
1. Open `http://localhost:8000/sidecar`
2. Go to the "Vision" tab
3. Drag and drop an image or click to upload
4. The image will be processed by the VLM
5. Results will be stored in the memory graph automatically

### Memory Search
1. Use the "Retrieve" tab in the sidecar
2. Enter your query and click "Fetch Context"
3. Copy the results to use in other applications

## Endpoints

- `GET /sidecar` - Serve the sidecar dashboard
- `GET /context` - Serve the context UI
- `POST /v1/vision/ingest` - Process uploaded images with VLM
- `POST /v1/memory/search` - Search the memory graph

## Architecture

The system follows a unified architecture where:
- The WebGPU Bridge (`webgpu_bridge.py`) serves UI files and orchestrates components
- Vision processing happens in Python via the Vision Engine
- Memory storage uses the graph database
- Communication between components happens via WebSockets

# Extension Icons

This directory contains the following icon files:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon (minimal valid PNG)
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixel icon (minimal valid PNG)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon (minimal valid PNG)

These icons represent the Sovereign Context Bridge extension.

Note: The current files are minimal valid PNGs for extension loading. Replace with actual designed icons for production use.

# Logs Directory

This directory contains individual log files for each system component to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## Log File Naming Convention

Each component writes to its own log file named after the source:

- `system.log` - System startup and general operations
- `chat_api.log` - Chat API requests and responses
- `memory_api.log` - Memory search API operations
- `websocket_bridge.log` - WebSocket connection events
- `python_stdout.log` - Python standard output
- `python_stderr.log` - Python standard error

## Log Rotation

Each log file is automatically truncated to keep only the last 1000 lines to prevent excessive disk usage.

## Log Format

Each log entry follows this format:
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] Message content
```

Where LEVEL is one of: INFO, SUCCESS, ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG

## Accessing Logs

- **Real-time viewing**: Use the log viewer at `http://localhost:8000/log-viewer.html`
- **File access**: Individual log files are available in this directory
- **API access**: Recent logs available via `/logs/recent` endpoint

# Changelog

All notable changes to the `scripts/` module will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Smart GPU Bridge**: Added `StaticFiles` mount at `/models` to serve local model artifacts.
- **On-Demand Downloads**: Added `POST /v1/models/pull` and `GET /v1/models/pull/status` to handle server-side model downloading from Hugging Face.
- **Shared Module**: Integrated `scripts.download_models` for reusable download logic.

### Fixed
- **CORS/Auth Collision**: Reordered `CORSMiddleware` to wrap the entire application (including Auth middleware) to ensure CORS headers are sent even on 401 Unauthorized responses.
- **Authentication**: Exempted `/models` path from Token Verification to allow browser-side fetching of artifacts without credentials.
- **Import Error**: Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` by changing import to `from download_models import ...` for direct script execution.

# Sovereign Architecture V2: The Ghost & The Shell

## 1. Overview
Architecture V2 decouples the **Interface** from the **Inference Engine**. 
Instead of a monolithic "Chat UI" inside a browser, the system splits into a background service (Ghost) and a lightweight client (Shell).

## 2. Component A: The Ghost (Headless Engine)
The Ghost is a background process responsible solely for loading the LLM into VRAM and exposing an API.

* **Current Implementation:** Headless Chromium (`launch-ghost.ps1`).
* **Future Implementation:** C++ Native Binary (`neural-ghost.exe`) using Dawn/WebGPU.
* **Responsibility:**
    * Manage WebGPU Context.
    * Load Weights (MLC-LLM).
    * Serve `localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions`.
    * **Stealth Mode:** Uses `NoCacheStaticFiles` to treat models as RAM-only data, bypassing browser storage quotas.
    * **Search Engine:** Provides hybrid search (Vector + BM25 FTS) via CozoDB WASM.

## 3. Component B: The Shell (Native Client)
The Shell is the user interface, residing in the user's native terminal environment (PowerShell, Bash, etc.).

* **Implementation:** Python Client (`tools/sov.py`).
* **Responsibility:**
    * Capture user input (`stdin`).
    * Send JSON payload to The Ghost.
    * Render streamed response to `stdout`.
    * Execute system commands (Agency).

## 4. The Data Flow
1.  **User:** Types `sov "List large files"` in PowerShell.
2.  **Shell:** Sends POST request to `localhost:8080`.
3.  **Bridge:** Forwards request to Headless Browser (Ghost) via Websocket/Fetch.
4.  **Ghost:** Runs inference on RTX 4090 via WebGPU.
5.  **Ghost:** Returns tokens -> Bridge -> Shell.
6.  **Shell:** Displays output or executes `Get-ChildItem` command.

## 5. Roadmap
- [x] **Phase 1:** "Stealth Mode" Cache Bypass (Completed).
- [x] **Phase 2:** Headless Browser Script (Completed).
- [x] **Phase 3:** `sov.py` Native Client Implementation.
- [x] **Phase 4:** Neural Shell Protocol (`/v1/shell/exec` endpoint).
- [x] **Phase 4.5:** Ghost Auto-Ignition (Auto-start with ?headless=true flag).
- [x] **Phase 5:** Native Shell Implementation (Anchor terminal with spawn endpoint).
- [ ] **Phase 6:** Migration to C++ Native Runtime (Removing Chrome entirely).

# Documentation Policy (Root Coda)

**Status:** Active | **Authority:** Human-Locked

## Core Philosophy
1. **Code is King:** Code is the only source of truth. Documentation is a map, not the territory.
2. **Visuals over Text:** Prefer Mermaid diagrams to paragraphs.
3. **Brevity:** Text sections must be <500 characters.
4. **Pain into Patterns:** Every major bug must become a Standard.
5. **LLM-First Documentation:** Documentation must be structured for LLM consumption and automated processing.

## Structure

### 1. The Blueprint (`specs/spec.md`)
*   **Role:** The single architectural source of truth.
*   **Format:** "Visual Monolith".
*   **Content:** High-level diagrams (Kernel, Memory, Logic, Bridge). No deep implementation details.

### 2. The Tracker (`specs/tasks.md`)
*   **Role:** Current work queue.
*   **Format:** Checklist.
*   **Maintenance:** Updated by Agents after every major task.

### 3. The Roadmap (`specs/plan.md`)
*   **Role:** Strategic vision.
*   **Format:** Phased goals.

### 4. Standards (`specs/standards/*.md`)
*   **Role:** Institutional Memory (The "Laws" of the codebase).
*   **Trigger:** Created after any bug that took >1 hour to fix OR any systemic improvement that affects multiple components.
*   **Format:** "The Triangle of Pain"
    1.  **What Happened:** The specific failure mode (e.g., "Bridge crashed on start").
    2.  **The Cost:** The impact (e.g., "3 hours debugging Unicode errors").
    3.  **The Rule:** The permanent constraint (e.g., "Force UTF-8 encoding on Windows stdout").

### 5. Local Context (`*/README.md`)
*   **Role:** Directory-specific context.
*   **Limit:** 1 sentence explaining the folder's purpose.

### 6. System-Wide Standards
*   **Universal Logging:** All system components must route logs to the central log collection system (Standard 013)
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The log viewer at `/log-viewer.html` is the single point for all system diagnostics
*   **Async Best Practices:** All async/await operations must follow proper patterns for FastAPI integration (Standard 014)
*   **Browser Control Center:** All primary operations must be accessible through unified browser interface (Standard 015)
*   **Detached Script Execution:** All data processing scripts must run in detached mode with logging to `logs/` directory (Standard 025)
*   **Ghost Engine Connection Management:** All memory operations must handle Ghost Engine disconnections gracefully with proper error reporting and auto-reconnection (Standard 026)
*   **No Resurrection Mode:** System must support manual Ghost Engine control via NO_RESURRECTION_MODE flag (Standard 027)
*   **Default No Resurrection:** Ghost Engine resurrection is disabled by default, requiring manual activation (Standard 028)
*   **Consolidated Data Aggregation:** Single authoritative script for data aggregation with multi-format output (Standard 029)
*   **Multi-Format Output:** Project aggregation tools must generate JSON, YAML, and text outputs for maximum compatibility (Standard 030)
*   **Ghost Engine Stability:** CozoDB schema creation must handle FTS failures gracefully to prevent browser crashes (Standard 031)
*   **Ghost Engine Initialization Flow:** Database initialization must complete before processing ingestion requests to prevent race conditions (Standard 032)
*   **CozoDB Syntax Compliance:** All CozoDB queries must use proper syntax to ensure successful execution (Standard 033)
*   **Node.js Monolith Migration:** System must migrate from Python/Browser Bridge to Node.js Monolith architecture (Standard 034)

## LLM Protocol
1. **Read-First:** Always read `specs/spec.md` AND `specs/standards/` before coding.
2. **Drafting:** When asked to document, produce **Mermaid diagrams** and short summaries.
3. **Editing:** Do not modify `specs/doc_policy.md` or `specs/spec.md` structure unless explicitly instructed.
4. **Archival:** Move stale docs to `archive/` immediately.
5. **Enforcement:** If a solution violates a Standard, reject it immediately.
6. **Standards Evolution:** New standards should follow the "Triangle of Pain" format and be numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.).
7. **Cross-Reference:** When creating new standards, reference related existing standards to maintain consistency.
8. **Detached Mode:** All LLM development scripts must run in detached mode (non-interactive) and log to files in the `logs/` directory with timestamped names (Standard 025).

# Verified MLC-LLM Model URLs

**Status:** Registry of verified WebLLM-compatible model URLs.
**Last Updated:** Dec 22, 2025
**Source:** `mlc-ai/web-llm` config and verified HTTP checks.

## Technology: WASM + WebGPU Inference

This project uses **WebLLM** (by MLC-AI) to run Large Language Models directly in the browser.

1.  **Compilation:** Models (Llama 3, Qwen 2.5, etc.) are compiled into **WebAssembly (WASM)** modules (`.wasm`). These modules contain the model's architecture and logic, optimized for execution in a web environment.
2.  **Acceleration:** The WASM module uses the **WebGPU API** to access the user's local GPU. This allows for massive parallelism, enabling 7B+ parameter models to run at interactive speeds (20-100+ tokens/sec) on consumer hardware.
3.  **Zero-Server:** No data leaves the browser. The "Backend" is the user's own GPU.

## Official Model Registry

**CRITICAL REFERENCE:** The definitive list of supported models and their WASM binaries can be found at:
- https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/blob/main/src/config.ts#L293
- This contains the official `prebuiltAppConfig` with verified model configurations

**ADDITIONAL VERIFIED LINKS:**
- https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/blob/main/src/config.ts#L293 - Contains verified MLC model configurations and working WASM URLs

---

## 1. Verified Models (Ready for Production)

These models have been verified to exist in the `v0_2_80` library and are compatible with the current `web-llm` version.

### 🌟 7B - 8B Class (Recommended)
Balanced performance for reasoning and chat. Requires 6GB+ VRAM.

## 3. URL Construction Logic

If you need to construct a URL manually:

```javascript
const libBase = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlc-ai/binary-mlc-llm-libs/main/web-llm-models/";
const version = "v0_2_80"; // Check src/config.ts for 'modelVersion'
const modelSpecificName = "Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-q4f16_1-ctx4k_cs1k-webgpu.wasm";

const fullUrl = `${libBase}${version}/${modelSpecificName}`;
```

**Note:** The `modelSpecificName` often differs slightly from the Hugging Face repo name (e.g., `Llama-3_1` vs `Llama-3.1` or `Qwen2` base for `DeepSeek`). Always check `mlc_config.ts` mapping.

# Anchor Core: The Visual Monolith (v3.6)

**Status:** Text-Only + Watchdog + Session Recorder + Context Persistence + Ghost Engine Resilience Architecture | **Philosophy:** Visual Command Center, Resource-Queued.

## 1. The Anchor Architecture
The **Anchor Core** (`webgpu_bridge.py`) is the unified server. The **Ghost Engine** is a headless browser window acting as the GPU Worker. **Watchdog** provides passive text ingestion.

## 2. Model Loading Strategy (Standard 007)
The system now uses an online-first model loading approach for reliability:
- **Primary**: Direct HuggingFace URLs for immediate availability
- **Fallback**: Local model files when available
- **Bridge Redirect**: `/models/{model}/resolve/main/{file}` handles resolution logic
- **Simplified Configuration**: Online-only approach prevents loading hangs (Standard 007)

## 3. Port Map

* **8000**: **The One Port.** Serves UI, API, Models, and WebSocket connections.

## 4. Search Architecture

* **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines Vector search (semantic) with BM25 (lexical) for optimal results.
* **BM25 FTS**: CozoDB Full Text Search with stemming and relevance scoring.
* **Context Manager**: Intelligent retrieval system in `ContextManager` class.

## 5. Ghost Engine Resilience (Standard 026)

* **Connection Management**: Automatic WebSocket connection monitoring with reconnection attempts
* **Graceful Degradation**: Proper error handling when Ghost Engine is disconnected (503 responses)
* **Status Indicators**: Clear logging and UI indicators for connection status
* **Auto-Resurrection**: Automatic recovery when Ghost Engine becomes available
* **Queue Processing**: Pending operations are processed when connection resumes

## 6. No Resurrection Mode (Standard 027)

* **Manual Control**: Option to disable automatic Ghost Engine launching via NO_RESURRECTION_MODE flag
* **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces resource usage by avoiding automatic browser launches
* **User Flexibility**: Allows users to connect Ghost Engine manually when needed
* **Existing Browser**: Enables use of existing browser windows instead of launching headless instances
* **Environment Variable**: Controlled via `set NO_RESURRECTION_MODE=true` before startup

## 7. Default No Resurrection Behavior (Standard 028)

* **Default Setting**: Ghost Engine resurrection is now disabled by default for resource efficiency
* **Manual Activation Required**: Users must explicitly open ghost.html to connect the Ghost Engine
* **Environment Override**: Set `NO_RESURRECTION_MODE=false` to enable auto-launching
* **Queued Processing**: Files and requests are queued until Ghost Engine connects
* **User Control**: Provides maximum control over when computational resources are used

## 8. Consolidated Data Aggregation (Standard 029)

* **Single Authority**: Use `context/Coding-Notes/Notebook/read_all.py` as the single authoritative script for data aggregation
* **Multi-Format Output**: Generates three formats - text corpus, JSON memory, and YAML memory
* **YAML Formatting**: Uses proper multiline string formatting for readability
* **Encoding Handling**: Robust encoding detection using chardet for reliable processing
* **Recursive Processing**: Processes all subdirectories while respecting exclusions
* **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains file metadata in structured outputs

## 9. Multi-Format Output for Project Aggregation (Standard 030)

* **Multi-Format Support**: The `read_all.py` script in the root directory generates both JSON and YAML versions of memory records

* **Custom Representers**: Implements custom YAML representers to handle multiline content appropriately
* **Maximum Compatibility**: Provides format flexibility for different downstream processing tools

## 10. Ghost Engine Stability Fix (Standard 031)

* **Separate Schema Creation**: Basic schema and FTS index creation must be handled separately to prevent failures
* **Graceful FTS Handling**: FTS creation failures should not prevent basic database functionality
* **Error Prevention**: Proper error handling prevents "undefined" error messages
* **Browser Stability**: Prevents browser crashes during database initialization
* **Fallback Operations**: System continues to function even if advanced features fail

## 11. Ghost Engine Initialization Flow (Standard 032)

* **Sequential Initialization**: Database must be fully initialized before signaling readiness to Bridge
* **Database Readiness Checks**: All operations verify database is properly initialized before execution
* **Proper Error Handling**: Return appropriate errors when database is not ready instead of failing silently
* **Synchronous Connection Flow**: Connect → Initialize Database → Signal Ready → Process Requests
* **Graceful Degradation**: Report initialization failures and avoid processing requests when database fails
* **Message Type Support**: Properly handle all message types including error responses

## 12. CozoDB Syntax Compliance (Standard 033)

* **Schema Creation Syntax**: Use proper CozoDB syntax without line breaks in schema definitions

# Model Loading Test Suite Documentation

## Overview
This document describes how the updated test suite has helped debug model loading issues in the Anchor Core system, particularly the dual loading system problems that caused inconsistent behavior across different UI components.

## The Dual Loading System Problem

### Background
The Anchor Core system had two different model loading pathways:
1. **Bridge-based loading**: Uses local file resolution via `/models/{model}/resolve/main/{file}` endpoint
2. **Direct online loading**: Uses direct HuggingFace URLs in the browser

### Issues Identified
- Models worked in some components (like `anchor-mic.html`) but not others (like `chat.html`)
- Confusion about which approach to use
- Inconsistent model availability across UI components
- Debugging time wasted trying to fix local file resolution when online loading worked

## Test Suite Updates and Their Debugging Impact

### 1. `verify_hf_models.py` - Hugging Face Verification
**Purpose**: Verify models are available on Hugging Face before local testing

**Debugging Impact**:
- Identified which models actually exist on Hugging Face
- Prevented wasted time on models that don't exist online
- Clarified the source of truth for model availability
- Revealed that some models listed in documentation don't have available binaries

### 2. `verify_local_models.py` - Local File Verification  
**Purpose**: Check if required model files exist locally in the models directory

**Debugging Impact**:
- Identified which models are properly downloaded and available locally
- Revealed that the models directory was empty in many cases
- Showed the difference between online availability and local presence
- Helped understand why local file resolution was failing

### 3. `verify_model_complete.py` - Complete Pipeline Verification
**Purpose**: End-to-end verification including Hugging Face → Local → Bridge availability

**Debugging Impact**:
- Revealed the complete pathway for model loading
- Identified exactly where in the chain models were failing
- Showed that some models were available via bridge redirects but not local files
- Provided clear categorization of model status (locally available, bridge available, needs download, unavailable)

## How the Test Suite Resolved the Issues

### 1. Separation of Concerns
**Before**: Single test tried to check both online and local availability, causing confusion
**After**: Separate tests for each verification type, allowing clear diagnosis

### 2. Online-First Verification with Redirect Handling
**Before**: Tests assumed local files existed without verifying online availability first
**After**: Tests first verify models exist on Hugging Face, then check local availability
**Key Discovery**: 307/302 redirect status codes indicate files exist on Hugging Face (not missing)

### 3. Clear Status Categorization
**Before**: Models were just "available" or "not available" with unclear reasons
**After**: Models categorized as:
- Available locally (ready to use immediately)
- Available via bridge (redirects to online sources)
- Need download (via `/v1/models/pull` endpoint)
- Completely unavailable (not on Hugging Face)

### 4. Bridge Redirect Validation
**Before**: No verification that the bridge redirect endpoint was working properly
**After**: Explicit testing of bridge redirect functionality to ensure it properly serves files

### 5. Key Finding - Models Are Available Online
**Critical Discovery**: All tested models are available on Hugging Face with 307 redirects, indicating they exist and can be downloaded. The issue was not with online availability but with local presence and download status.

## Resolution of Dual Loading System Issues

### Problem: Inconsistent Behavior
- `anchor-mic.html` worked with online loading
- `chat.html` failed with local file resolution
- Confusion about which approach to use

### Solution: Test Suite Insights
The test suite revealed:
1. Online loading (like in `anchor-mic.html`) works when models are available on Hugging Face
2. Local file resolution (like in `chat.html`) fails when files aren't properly downloaded
3. Bridge redirects can serve as a fallback when local files don't exist
4. The system needs to handle both pathways gracefully

### Recommended Approach
Based on test results and Standard 008 (Online-Only Approach):
1. First attempt to load via bridge redirect (which can serve local or redirect to online)
2. Fallback to direct online loading if bridge fails
3. Use consistent configuration patterns across all UI components
4. Test both pathways during development to ensure compatibility

### Actual Solution: Download Required Models (Enhanced Bridge Redirect)
Based on the verification results, all models are available on Hugging Face but need to be downloaded to the local models directory:

```bash
# Example: Download the Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B model using the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/models/pull \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sovereign-secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_id": "mlc-ai/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC",
    "url": "https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC"
  }'
```

**Enhanced Bridge Redirect Implementation**: The system now implements Standard 009's bridge redirect logic:
- **Check Local First**: When requesting `/models/{file_path}`, the bridge first checks for the file locally
- **Serve Local**: If found locally, serves with proper no-cache headers
- **Redirect Online**: If missing locally, redirects to HuggingFace with HTTP 302
- **Fallback Resilience**: This ensures models work even if not downloaded locally

After downloading models, they will be available for both local loading and bridge redirects. However, the enhanced bridge now provides automatic fallback to online sources when local files are missing.

## Verification Workflow

### For New Models:
1. Run `verify_hf_models.py` to ensure model exists on Hugging Face
2. Download model if needed using `/v1/models/pull` endpoint
3. Run `verify_local_models.py` to confirm local availability
4. Run `verify_model_complete.py` for end-to-end verification
5. Test in browser components

### For Troubleshooting:
1. If model fails to load in UI, run complete verification to identify where it fails
2. Check Hugging Face availability first
3. Verify local file presence
4. Test bridge redirect functionality
5. Apply appropriate fix based on verification results

## Conclusion

The updated test suite has successfully resolved the dual loading system confusion by:
- Separating online and local verification concerns
- Providing clear status categorization
- Enabling systematic debugging of model loading issues
- Supporting both loading pathways with clear fallback strategies
- Following the "online-first" approach documented in standards

This systematic approach prevents the "groundhog day" effect where the same model loading issues are debugged repeatedly without understanding the root cause.

# Sovereign WASM Specification (Root Kernel)

## Architecture Overview
The **Root Coda** system runs entirely in the browser using a unified Kernel (`sovereign.js`) that manages Compute (WebLLM) and Memory (CozoDB).

## 1. The Kernel (`tools/modules/sovereign.js`)
The Kernel is the standard library for all Root Tools. It enforces consistency and safety.

### 1.1 Hardware Abstraction ("Snapdragon Fix")
**Problem**: Adreno GPUs (Snapdragon X Elite) and some mobile chips crash if a WebGPU buffer >256MB is requested, or if context exceeds 4k tokens without specific driver flags.
**Solution**: `getWebGPUConfig(profile)`
- **Lite**: Clamps buffer to 256MB, Context to 2048.
- **Mid**: Clamps buffer to 1GB, Context to 4096.
- **High/Ultra**: Unlocked.

### 1.2 Unified Logging
**Problem**: `console.log` is invisible on mobile or when running as a PWA.
**Solution**: `SovereignLogger`
- Broadcasts all logs to `BroadcastChannel('sovereign-logs')`.
- Consumed by `log-viewer.html` for real-time remote debugging.

### 1.3 Reactive State
**Problem**: Spaghetti code updating DOM elements manually.
**Solution**: `createStore(initialState)`
- Lightweight `Proxy`-based store.
- Components subscribe to changes: `subscribe((key, val) => updateUI(key, val))`.

## 2. Memory Layer (CozoDB WASM)
The Kernel provides a standardized loader: `initCozo(wasmPath)`.

### Data Portability
- **Lossless Export**: The Root Builder features a "Lossless Export" button.
- **Mechanism**: Dumps full Cozo relations (including vectors) to a JSON file.
- **Use Case**: Transfer full "Brain" state between devices or backup.

### Search Enhancement (BM25 FTS)
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines vector search (semantic) with BM25 FTS (lexical) for optimal results.
- **Index Creation**: FTS index created during initialization: `::fts create memory:content_fts`
- **Stemming Support**: Uses English stemming for better word variation matching.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Maintains regex-based search when FTS index unavailable.

### Schema
```datalog
:create memory {
    id: String
    =>
    timestamp: Int,
    role: String,
    content: String,
    source: String,
    embedding: <F32; 384>
}
```

## 3. Tool Bridge (Legacy Support)
The `webgpu_bridge.py` acts as a secure relay (websocket <-> http) for external tools (like VS Code extensions) to access the Browser's LLM.
- **Input**: HTTP/REST (`/v1/chat/completions`)
- **Output**: WebSocket (`ws://localhost:8080/ws/chat`)

### 3.1 Local Model Serving (Storage Quota Bypass)
**Problem**: Browsers (especially in Incognito/Guest modes) strictly limit persistent storage (e.g., <300MB), preventing the caching of large LLM weights (~2GB+).
**Solution**: The Bridge acts as a local HTTP File Server.
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8080/models/{model_id}/...`
- **Mechanism**: 
    1. Frontend requests model from localhost.
    2. If 404, Frontend triggers `POST /v1/models/pull`.
    3. Bridge downloads artifacts from Hugging Face to `./models`.
    4. Frontend polls status and loads the model into RAM (bypassing IndexedDB quota).

## 4. Audio Input (Root Mic)
**Goal**: Pure client-side speech-to-text without sending audio to a cloud.

### 4.1 Pipeline
1. **Capture**: `MediaRecorder` (WebM) -> 48kHz decoding.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Downsampling to 16kHz (Whisper Native).
   - **Noise Gate**: Discards audio if peak amplitude < 0.01 (Prevents transcribing silence).
   - **Amplification**: Smart gain (max 5x) for quiet voices, but capped to avoid boosting noise floor.
3. **Inference (WASM)**: 
   - Model: `Xenova/whisper-tiny.en` (Quantized).
   - **Long-form Strategy**: Uses `chunk_length_s: 30` and `stride_length_s: 5` to process audio exceeding the model's native 30s window.
4. **Post-Processing (Refinement)**:
   - **Hallucination Filter**: Regex removal of common Whisper artifacts (e.g., "[Music]", "Applause", "Amara.org").
   - **LLM Cleanup**: The raw transcript is passed to the local Qwen2.5 instance with a system prompt to fix grammar/punctuation without altering meaning.

### 4.2 Summarization Loop
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Summarize & Clarify" after a successful transcription.
- **Process**: The cleaned transcript is sent back to the Local Kernel (Qwen2.5) with a prompt to "summarize and clarify core meaning."
- **Output**: The transcript is replaced by the summary, which is automatically copied to the clipboard.

## 5. Parallel Compute (The Worker)
To prevent UI freezing during heavy inference, the LLM runs in a dedicated Web Worker.

### 5.1 `tools/modules/llm-worker.js`
- **Role**: Hosts the `MLCEngine` instance.
- **Communication**: Uses `WebWorkerMLCEngineHandler` to bridge messages between the main thread and the worker.
- **Benefit**: Ensures the UI remains responsive (scrolling, typing) even while the GPU is crunching tokens.

## 6. Resource Management (Orchestrator)
**Problem**: Multiple browser tabs (Mic, Console, Dreamer) competing for the single GPU resource led to deadlocks, timeouts, and "Device Lost" errors.
**Solution**: A Priority-Queue based Locking System with enhanced timeout handling and emergency procedures.

### 6.1 GPU Controller (`tools/modules/sovereign.js`)
- **Serialized Loading**: `withModelLoadLock()` ensures only one tab loads a model at a time, preventing GPU overload during initial loading.
- **Access Priority**:
  - **Priority 0 (High)**: Root Mic (Voice Input - cannot wait)
  - **Priority 10 (Med)**: Root Console (Chat - user waiting)
  - **Priority 15 (Med)**: Default priority
  - **Priority 20 (Low)**: Root Dreamer (Background tasks)
- **Timeouts**: Increased broken-lock timeout from 60s to **120s** (2 minutes) to accommodate large model loading.
- **Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism with proper error handling.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Direct WebGPU access when bridge unavailable.
- **Status Checking**: Added GPU status check functionality.
- **Emergency Release**: If a lock is held >120s, it is forcibly broken to prevent system deadlock.

### 6.2 Bridge Orchestration (`smart_gpu_bridge.py`)
- **Queue Tracking**: Tracks request start times to prevent starvation.
- **Enhanced Timeouts**: Increased timeout from 60s to 120s for lock acquisition.
- **Request Tracking**: Added request_start_times to prevent queue starvation.
- **Enhanced Status**: Detailed queue information in status endpoint.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /v1/gpu/status`: Monitor active locks and queue depth.
  - `POST /v1/gpu/lock`: Acquire lock (blocking).
  - `POST /v1/gpu/unlock`: Release GPU lock.
  - `POST /v1/gpu/reset`: Standard reset.
  - `POST /v1/gpu/force-release-all`: Nuclear option for stuck states.
  - `POST /v1/gpu/force-release`: Emergency release endpoint.
  - `POST /v1/hot-reload`: Hot reload endpoint for development.

### 6.3 GPU Management Utilities
- **GPU Manager Script** (`scripts/gpu_manager.py`): Command-line tool to monitor and manage GPU resources.
- **Test Script** (`scripts/test_gpu_fixes.py`): Comprehensive testing of GPU resource management.
- **Monitoring Commands**:
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --status`: Check GPU status
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --monitor --interval 10`: Monitor continuously
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --force-release`: Force release GPU locks
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --reset`: Standard reset
  - `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --hot-reload`: Trigger hot reload

## 7. Development Infrastructure
**Problem**: Restarting the Python bridge and refreshing 3 browser tabs for every small code change is slow.

### 7.1 Hot Reload System
- **Backend**: `smart_gpu_bridge.py` monitors its own source code (and `download_models.py`) for changes. It automatically reloads the Python process while preserving active WebSocket connections if possible.
- **Frontend**: `gpu-hot-reloader.js` connects to the bridge via WebSocket. When the bridge signals a reload (or detects an HTML update), the browser auto-refreshes.
- **Safety**: Automatically releases all GPU locks during a reload event to prevent "Ghost Locks".

# Protocol 001: Autonomous Execution & Service Verification

## The Rule
When executing any service, server, or long-running task, the Agent MUST:

1.  **Isolate Logs:** Create a dedicated log file (e.g., `logs/startup_checks.log`).
2.  **Detached Execution:** Launch the process in background/detached mode.
    - *Linux/Mac:* `nohup node src/index.js > ../logs/server.log 2>&1 &`
    - *Windows:* `Start-Process node -ArgumentList "src/index.js" -RedirectStandardOutput "../logs/server.log" -WindowStyle Hidden`
3.  **The "Pulse Check":**
    - Wait 5 seconds.
    - Read the log file to check for "Error" or "Exception".
4.  **Verification:**
    - If the log shows "Listening on port X", perform a HTTP GET to `/health` to confirm.
    - ONLY then declare success.

# Tools Changelog

## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-01 "Anchor Lite Refactor"
### Changed
- Renamed `chat.html` to `ghost.html` (Headless Engine).
- Refactored `context.html` to be the primary Search Dashboard.
### Removed
- Archived `db_builder.html`, `memory-builder.html`, `mobile-chat.html`.
- Removed auto-loading of WebLLM to save resources.


## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **On-Demand Model Serving**: `model-server-chat.html` now checks `http://localhost:8080/models/{id}` before loading. If missing, it triggers a download via the Bridge.
- **Quota Bypass**: Using `useIndexedDBCache: false` for large models to bypass browser storage limits, relying on the Bridge's local file server instead.

### Fixed
- **Model ID Mismatch**: Fixed logic in `loadModel` where the `mlc-ai/` prefix was being aggressively stripped, causing config lookups to fail.
- **UI Progress**: Added real-time progress bars for server-side model downloads.

 - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Orchestrator Model:** New `orchestrator.py` tool to programmatically interact with the MLC Bridge from Python.
- **Health Endpoint:** Added `/health` to `webgpu_bridge.py` for extension connectivity checks.
- **Audit Whitelist:** Added `/audit/server-logs` to auth whitelist in Bridge to fix Log Viewer 401 errors.

### Changed
- **Bridge Port:** Moved standard bridge port from `8000` to `8080` to avoid conflicts with `http.server`.
- **Launch Scripts:** Updated `start-sovereign-console.bat` and `launch-chromium-d3d12.bat` to respect new port `8080` and correct paths.
- **Root Dreamer:**
  - Robustified `init()` to handle non-Error objects during crash.
  - Improved JSON parsing to strip markdown code blocks before parsing.
  - Added strict engine readiness check to `dreamLoop` to prevent race conditions.
- **Root Console:**
  - Added "High Performance (Small)" models (Qwen 2.5 1.5B, TinyLlama) to the dropdown.
  - Updated JS mapper to handle new small model paths.
  - Fixed crash in `executeR1Loop` where `genErr.message` could be undefined.

### Fixed
- **WebGPU Crash:** Mitigated `DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED` by advising single-tab usage and providing smaller model options for constrained profiles.
- **Extension Connection:** Fixed CORS and Port mismatch preventing the Chrome Extension from connecting to the Bridge.

"""
Daemon Eyes - Background Vision Service for Anchor Core

This script provides automated screen observation for the Anchor Core system.
It captures screenshots at regular intervals, performs OCR, and sends the
extracted text to the Anchor Core bridge for automatic memory ingestion.

The goal is to provide "digital proprioception" - automatic awareness of
what the user is looking at without requiring manual input.

## Available Modes

### Standard Mode (Default)
- Automatically launches Ghost Engine (headless browser) for memory operations
- Runs all services in background with auto-resurrection

### Low Resource Mode
- Set `LOW_RESOURCE_MODE=true` before running to reduce memory/GPU usage
- Optimized for constrained devices

### CPU Only Mode
- Set `CPU_ONLY_MODE=true` before running to disable GPU acceleration
- Uses CPU for all operations

### No Resurrection Mode
- Set `NO_RESURRECTION_MODE=true` before running to disable auto-launching of Ghost Engine
- Allows manual control of Ghost Engine connection via browser
- Useful when you want to use an existing browser window or conserve resources
